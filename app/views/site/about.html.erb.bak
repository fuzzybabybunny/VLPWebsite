      <p><b>Victor Lin </b>was a newcomer to real estate photography back in 2009. Always a tinkerer and someone who had a passion for adventure and &quot;figuring things out,&quot; he devised and practiced all of the photography and videography techniques the team uses, which he now trains other talented creatives to do. In this way he personally ensures his original vision and quality is followed, but is constantly tweaking things to make them better for the customer. </p>
      <p>He pioneered the <b>Unlimited HDR Photography</b> package. While other agencies limited the number of shots they gave to agents, Victor always felt that this was limiting client choice and cutting corners. So he continues to instruct his team to give as many images to the client as they want, knowing that clients will appreciate having all the &quot;angles&quot; covered, so to speak.      </p>
