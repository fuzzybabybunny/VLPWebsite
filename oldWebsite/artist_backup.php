        <p><strong>My first camera</strong> was given to me by my uncle in 2003 as a high school graduation present. I don't think anyone knew back then how that combination of silicon, glass, and plastic would end up changing my life. Now as I reflect back to that time, I realize that through all the changes in my life, from switching majors three times to all the trips I've taken in an effort to find myself, my love of photography has been one of the only things to have stayed constant. Times changed, people changed, and places changed, but my passion for photography was always there.</p>
        <p><em>"It was like lying in a great solemn cathedral, far vaster and more beautiful than any built by the hand of man."</em><br />
          -Theodore Roosevelt, on camping in Yosemite </p>
        <p><strong>I was introduced to the open road</strong> at the age of 14 when my geology class traveled out west and visited places such as Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain National Park, and the Grand Tetons. This trip </p>

      <div id="split_right">
        <p>completely changed my life and I found that a wanderlust had been awakened within me. Since that time, I have traveled all across the United States, with camera in hand, to visit these &quot;solemn cathedrals&quot; as well as enjoy the local culture, cuisine, and cityscapes.</p>
        <p><strong>I'm a relative newcomer to real estate photography.</strong> After graduating college in 2008 with a degree in supply chain management I had a difficult time finding a job in the unfortunate economic climate. Like the pioneers of old, I traveled west to California from my home state of Ohio to look for better opportunities. I then partnered up with  the wonderful people at <a href="http://onetwosixdesign.com/">One Two Six Design</a>, a staging company in the Bay Area. My strong photography talent meant that I almost immediately started producing excellent images, and I look forward to growing my business, my brand, and my relationships with the realtors in the area.</p>
