  <h1>At the top of the page are two links to your virtual tour. You can use these to share your tour with customers, other realtors, websites, and MLS companies. Below this are all the websites that this tour can be posted to. </h1>
    <h1><strong>NOTE</strong>: Posting to Realtor.com may incur additional charges if you are not a Realtor.com Showcase Member. A listing for the property must be made on Realtor.com<em> first</em> before posting the virtual tour to Realtor.com, and the address on the Realtor.com listing <em>must match exactly</em> the address on the virtual tour in order to attach successfully.</h1>
    <h1><strong>NOTE</strong>: If your local MLS service is not available in the drop down list, you must manually submit the tour to them.    </h1>
    <h1>After all desired options are selected, submit the tour using the <strong>Submit to the selected destinations</strong> button.</h1>
